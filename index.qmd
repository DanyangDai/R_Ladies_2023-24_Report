Huge thanks to Caitlin who continue to support us from Africa! 


# New and shiny Slack Channel

Thanks to Kathleen, we have now a Slack-pro account! This allow us to keep all of our past conversion within Slack and not needing to worry about the 30-days limits. 

To further the benefits of Slack Pro account, we have migrate the general R-Ladies Committee members to the pro-Slack workplace. This allow us to have a closer interaction with our committee members. 

Thanks to Kathleen, we have also cleaned up our slack channels. Now with fewer channels, it has improved the efficiency of our communications.


# New R-Ladies T-shirts and Mugs coming up!

We are looking forward to have new R-Ladies T-shirts and mugs coming this year! Thanks to Caitlin and Dionne for organizing the designs and pick-up for us.

# The branding change initiative for R-Ladies 

In the past few years, I had friends that identified themselves as gender minorities but didn't want to get involved with R-Ladies Melbourne due to our name and branding. Evie had sent an email to the R-Ladies global to raise this issue. Finally this year, R-Ladies Global has opened the discussion around changing the brand to something that is more inclusive. This initiative can be found at: [https://github.com/rladies/community/issues/10](https://github.com/rladies/community/issues/10)

We are looking forward for a more inclusive name!


# Note from Daidai 

It has been a challenging year since we had few personnel changes. I thought that there wasn't much happening in the past year. However, when I was drafting this report, I realized the amount of work we have been doing and a lot of new and positive changes happened in the past year. i.e. our new slack channels and incoming new T-shirts! I am grateful to have all the supports from you from Brisbane and I had fun working with you all! I am looking forward for another amazing year at R-Ladies Melbourne.

# Sponsors
